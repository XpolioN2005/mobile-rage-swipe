## Core Gameplay
Core Loop:  
- Climb upward through precise jumps in mechanical dungeon segments.  
- Player = glowing sphere; wings appear briefly on jump to indicate lift.  
- Falling into hazards = instant restart.  

Objectives / Win Conditions:  
- Reach the top of each tower segment or the full dungeon.  

Game Modes / Levels:  
- Single-player tower climb  
- Optional endless climb mode  
- Levels consist of short, precise sequences with mechanical traps  

Controls / Input:  
- One-touch jump / swipe for movement  
- Optional hold slows time slightly for micro-adjustments  

Difficulty / Scaling:  
- Brutally high; tight platform spacing and fast hazards.  
- Later levels introduce more complex mechanical traps, moving platforms, retractable spikes.  

---

## Story / Characters
Synopsis / Premise:  
- Abstract, minimal story: climb through a mechanical dungeon to reach the light at the top.  

World / Setting:  
- Mechanical dungeon aesthetic: gears, pistons, moving platforms, conveyor hazards.  
- Dark backgrounds with illuminated platforms; focus on player’s light sphere.  

Main Characters:  
- Player: glowing sphere with ephemeral wings on jump.  
- Hazards: spikes, crushing platforms, rotating gears, moving walls.  

Story Progression / Quests:  
- Procedural or hand-designed segments for tower climb.  
- Optional leaderboards or “fastest climb” challenges.  

---

## Mechanics
Core Systems:  
- Physics-based climbing and jumping.  
- Single-input control system.  
- Instant-death hazards; falling resets player to start.  

Rules / Constraints:  
- No double jump.  
- Wings appear only while ascending.  
- Minimal visual feedback, relies on environmental cues.  

Progression / Metrics:  
- Height climbed per attempt.  
- Death count / retries.  
- Optional speedrun or time metrics.  

Physics / Interaction:  
- Gravity affects jump arcs.  
- Player interacts with platforms and hazard collisions precisely.  
- Wings provide temporary visual feedback, no gameplay effect.  

---

## Assets
Visuals / Art Style:  
- Dark mechanical dungeon, minimalist lighting.  
- Player is glowing sphere; ephemeral wings animate on jump.  
- Platforms are simple geometric shapes, gears, and pistons.  

Audio / Music / SFX:  
- Minimal industrial / ambient mechanical sounds.  
- Subtle jump and hazard SFX.  
- Focus on atmosphere and tension.  

Animations / FX:  
- Smooth jump arcs, wings fade in/out.  
- Subtle mechanical motion for hazards.  

Technical Notes:  
- Portrait layout, Android optimized.  
- Lightweight assets for low-end devices.  

---

## UI / UX
Layout / HUD:  
- No HUD during active climbing.  
- Minimalist indicators only in menus or after failure.  

Menus / Navigation:  
- Start, pause, retry screens only.  
- Quick restart from tower base.  

Feedback / Notifications:  
- Visual feedback comes from environment and player wings.  
- Minimal sound cues for hazard proximity.  

---

## Monetization
In-app Purchases / DLC:  
- Optional cosmetic player colors or wing effects.  

Ads / Premium Content:  
- Optional rewarded ads to retry after fall.  

Pricing / Revenue Model:  
- Free-to-play core with cosmetic purchases.

## Notes / Ideas
- Consider subtle procedural variation in tower segments for replayability.  
- Emphasize tension through minimalism: dark dungeon + light sphere.  
- Player feedback through motion, sound, and wings rather than UI.  
- Leaderboards and speedrun tracking optional.
